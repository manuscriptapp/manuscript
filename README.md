## Overview

Manuscript is a **native, open-source writing app** designed for writers who want **full control over their files**. It works on iOS and macOS, supports project-based writing, Markdown editing, snapshots, and optional AI-assisted writing.

The goal: provide a Scrivener-like experience **without lock-in**, fully open-source, and free to use.

## Key Features

- **Project-based writing**: Organize chapters, notes, and research in one place
- **Markdown support**: Flexible formatting, portable files
- **Snapshots & undo history**: Safe writing environment

- **AI-assisted writing (optional)**:

  - **Bring Your Own AI** — use your own API keys (OpenAI, etc.)

## Philosophy

- **Files first**: Your writing belongs to you, not the cloud
